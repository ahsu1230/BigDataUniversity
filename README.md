Introduction Courses to Hadoop (from http://bigdatauniversity.com)

Courses are from BigDataUniversity.
Some of these courses are not completed yet, 
but all courses give a certificate if final test/exam is passed.

Numbers before course number relay the pre-requisite order for courses.
For example, take Hadoop Fundamentals (level 2) ONLY after 
you finish the Introduction to Map Reduce Programming (level 1) course.

Lots of courses, just do it.
