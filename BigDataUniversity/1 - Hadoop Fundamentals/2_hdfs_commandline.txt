HDFS Command Line Interface

Familiar to UNIX
 - HDFS can either be manipulated through Java API or through command line interface
 - All commands begin are in format "hadoop fs" (for file system shell)

File System Shell (fs)
$ hadoop fs <args>

Example: Listing current directory in hdfs
$ hadoop fs -ls


First run start.sh script to bring up Hadoop nodes
	- the NameNode
	- the 2nd NameNode
	- a   DataNode
	- the Jobtracker
	- a   Tasktracker

Path URI (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
    URI format consts of scheme, authority, and path
	(scheme://authority/path)
    Scheme:
    	local filesystem, scheme=file
	HDFS, scheme=hdfs
    Example: Copy a file called "myfile.txt" from local system to HDFS file system (on localhost)
		-copyFromLocal command takes URIs for source and destination (scheme/authority are optional and have default values)
	hadoop fs -copyFromLocal
		file://myfile.txt
		hdfs://localhost/user/aaron/myfile.txt

copyFromLocal == put 	: copy files from local filesystem to specified filesystem
CopyToLocal == get	: cope files out of specified filesystem to local
getmerge		: extension of get (merges files from multiple locations to single local file)

$ hadoop fs -put myfile.txt hdfs://localhost/myfile.txt
$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal myfile.txt hdfs://localhost/myfile2.txt
$ hadoop fs -getmerge hdfs://localhost/myfiles.txt

setRep			: override default level of replication (for one file)
			: use -R for an entire file tree
			: use -w to wait until new replication level is achieved
$ hadoop fs -setrep [-R][-w]<rep><path>
