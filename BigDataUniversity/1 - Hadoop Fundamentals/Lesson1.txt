What is Hadoop?
open source project of the Apache Foundation
Framework written in Java, uses Google MapReduce & File System?

Optimized to handle massive amounts of data through parallelism
		Data can be structured/unstructured
		Doesn't require expensive hardware
Great performance (concurrent processing)
Reliability provided through replication (over different computers)

Bad for: OLTP (online transaction processing) where data is randomly accessed from structure data
Bad for: OLAP (online analytical processing) where data is sequentially accessed from structure data

Good for: Big Data - complements OLTP & OLAP.
	  Big Data is when data grows so large & quickly
		that it is difficult to manage on regular database or usual statistic tools

Open Source Projects
Eclipse	(IBM)
Lucene 	(text search engine in Java)
Hbase 	(Hadoop database)
Hive 	(data warehousing tools to query data in Hadoop files)
Pig 	(platform for analyzing large data sets)
Jaql  	(query language for JavaScript open notation)

Hadoop is not for all types of work:
 - data is randomly accessed (not good for process transactions)
 - not good for work cannot be parallelized
 - not good for low latency data access
 - not good for lots of small files
 - not good for little data

Big Data <3 Cloud
	- Cloud allows you to set up cluster of systems
	- on demand, and inexpensive (pay for what you use)
