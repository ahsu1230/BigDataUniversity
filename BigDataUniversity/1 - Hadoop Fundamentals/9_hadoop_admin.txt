Hadoop Administration

:::::: Adding / Removing nodes from Cluster ::::::
Can be performed from BigInsights Web console or terminal
 - requires IP address or node (that is reachable)
	i.e. test to see if it's reachable: ssh 192.168.44.15
 - Adding a slave node SHOULD not have BigInsights/Hadoop software
 - must edit /etc/hosts on both master/slave nodes
	* hostnames & ip addresses

i.e. with terminal
cd $BIGINSIGHTS_HOME/bin
./addnode.sh hadoop ipaddr,password
./removenode.sh ipaddr
./listnode.sh


:::::: Verifying cluster health ::::::::::::::::::
Observe Status tab in BigInsights Web console

i.e. with terminal
hadoop dfsadmin -report

Performs DFS Disk Check to determine if low disk storage


:::::: Stopping / Starting components/services :::

Not all services/components may need to be running
Stopping some can save resources
i.e. with terminal

./stop.sh hadoop console
